### Plan Information

With Integra Harmony (HMO SNP), you get all the benefits you would get under Original Medicare, plus extra benefits. In addition, you have access to all your Medicaid benefits, and Medicaid pays for your Medicare cost-sharing, which means you pay $0. Our plan also includes Part D prescription drugs – and because you receive “extra help” with prescription drugs, your copayments are low. Some of the extra benefits included with Integra Harmony (HMO SNP) include:

* Vision
* Dental
* Hearing Aids
* Over the counter allowance
