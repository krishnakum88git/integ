Medicare Advantage Plans are available to Medicare eligible individuals with Medicare Part A and B coverage and who live in New York City (all 5 Boroughs - Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond), and Nassau County. Our Plan provides Medicare Beneficiaries with ALL Original Medicare benefits, including Part D prescription drug plus additional benefits not covered by Medicare. 

At Integra Managed Care HMO, our goal is to improve the quality of life of our members in the communities where they live. We recognize that access to care, quality providers and reasonable costs are major concerns and we also recognize that many other issues impact the quality of life such as lifestyle issues, disease management and access to services within the community. It is our goal to understand and respond to these life issues by partnering with and helping community organizations in a variety of ways. We believe this comprehensive approach will result in not only improved health care but also improved health. 

Integra Managed Care HMO is offering two Medicare Advantage Plans, one for beneficiaries with Medicare and one for beneficiaries with Medicare and Medicaid. Please review our plan options on this site or call Member Services, at the numbers shown, to answer your questions and to arrange a visit with one of our representatives. We look forward to hearing from you.
